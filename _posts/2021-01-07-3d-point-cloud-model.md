### 点云建模
* [PointNet: Deep Learning on Point Sets for 3D Classification and Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593) by Qi et al. (CVPR 2017) Pioneer work for 3D point cloud classification and segmentation.

* <a href="http://stanford.edu/~rqi/pointnet2/" target="_blank">PointNet++: Deep Hierarchical Feature Learning on Point Sets in a Metric Space</a> by Qi et al. (NIPS 2017) A hierarchical feature learning framework on point clouds. The PointNet++ architecture applies PointNet recursively on a nested partitioning of the input point set. It also proposes novel layers for point clouds with non-uniform densities.

* <a href="http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017_workshops/papers/w13/Engelmann_Exploring_Spatial_Context_ICCV_2017_paper.pdf" target="_blank">Exploring Spatial Context for 3D Semantic Segmentation of Point Clouds</a> by Engelmann et al. (ICCV 2017 workshop). This work extends PointNet for large-scale scene segmentation.

* <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04954" target="_blank">PCPNET: Learning Local Shape Properties from Raw Point Clouds</a> by Guerrero et al. (arXiv). The work adapts PointNet for local geometric properties (e.g. normal and curvature) estimation in noisy point clouds.

* <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06396" target="_blank">VoxelNet: End-to-End Learning for Point Cloud Based 3D Object Detection</a> by Zhou et al. from Apple (arXiv) This work studies 3D object detection using LiDAR point clouds. It splits space into voxels, use PointNet to learn local voxel features and then use 3D CNN for region proposal, object classification and 3D bounding box estimation.

* <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08488" target="_blank">Frustum PointNets for 3D Object Detection from RGB-D Data</a> by Qi et al. (arXiv) A novel framework for 3D object detection with RGB-D data. The method proposed has achieved first place on KITTI 3D object detection benchmark on all categories (last checked on 11/30/2017).
